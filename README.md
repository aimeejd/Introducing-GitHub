# Introducing-GitHub
Module 6-Discussion

Do you foresee yourself using GitHub in the future? Why or why not?
I do not see myself using GitHub because I don't understand what it's purpose is and why people use it. I have heard of it but I never looked into it. I like to stick to things I know how to use.

Did you find it easy to use?
No, I did not find it easy to use because I don't exactly know what I'm doing. The tutorial was sometimes difficult because there are slight differences. I was a little frustrated with the directions. 

What was the muddiest point for you as you worked through the online tutorial?
The muddiest point is I don't know if I'm doing this assignment correctly. I did the turorial excercise but I didn't know what I was doing. I'm not sure what the branching is and the commit changes are doing. I'm very confused.
